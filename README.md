# Deep-Learning
In this repository I have collected and adapted some of the most relevant jupyter notebooks from programming assignments of the DeepLearning.ai Coursera course.

In the requirements.txt file are collected all libraries of my python environment on which I have run the notebooks. Some pretrained models used in few projects are not included here since they are too large, however, they can be easly found online.

- **01-Building-a-Deep-Neural-Network-Step-by-Step**: a tutorial on building a Neural Network model from scratch with numpy
- **02-Deep-Neural-Network-Application-with-numpy**: applying the model created with numpy to a binary classification problem.
- **03-TensorFlow-Tutorial**: a tutorial on basic usage of the TensorFlow framework and with a practical example on creating a model for recognizing hands signs numbers from pictures.
- **04-Building-a-CNN-Step-by-Step**: a tutorial on how to build a Convolutional Neural Network for both forward and backward propagation using only numpy.
- **05-CNN-with-TensorFlow** a tutorial on how to build a Convolutional Neural Network model with Tensorflow that recognizes SIGN language.
- **06-Keras-Tutorial** a tutorial on building a simple CNN model with keras
- **07-Building-ResNet** In this notebook it is shown how to build a ResNet CNN model (an advance model architecture in general) step-by-step using keras.
- **08-Car-detection-for-Autonomous-Driving** In this notebook there is a detailed guide on how object detection works with YOLO. I then used a pretrained version of YOLO_v2 model for car detection.
- **09-Face-Recognition** In this notebook I have developed both a face verification and a face recognition model and applied it to the "Happy house" problem
- **10-Art-Generation-Neural-Style-Transfer** Step-by-step guide on how to generate images with the artistic style of your prefered painter using Neural-Style-Transfer. 
- **11-Building-a-Recurrent-Neural-Network-Step-by-Step**: a tutorial on building the forwards propagation of a Recurrent Neural Network with only numpy.
- **12-Jazz-improvisation-with-LSTM**: example on how to generate Jazz music with LSTM
