# Deep-Learning
In this repository I have collected and adapted some of the most relevant jupyter notebooks from programming assignments of the DeepLearning.ai Coursera course.

In the requirements.txt file are collected all libraries of my python environment on which I have run the notebooks.

## The Projects:
- **Building a Deep Neural Network-Step by Step**: A tutorial on building a Neural Network model from scratch with numpy
- **Deep Neural Network Application: Image Classification**: Applying the model created with numpy to a binary classification problem.
- **TensorFlow tutorial**: A tutorial on basic usage of the TensorFlow framework and with a practical example on creating a model for recognizing hands signs numbers from pictures.
- **Building a CNN-Step by Step**: a tutorial on how to build a Convolutional Neural Network for both forward and backward propagation using only numpy.
- **CNN with TensorFlow**: a tutorial on how to build a Convolutional Neural Network model with Tensorflow that recognizes SIGN language.
- **Keras-Tutorial**: building a simple CNN model with keras
- **Building ResNet**: In this notebook it is shown how to build a ResNet CNN network step-by-step using keras
